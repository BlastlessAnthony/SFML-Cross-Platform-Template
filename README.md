# SFML Template for Cross Platform development  
![SFML Logo](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/goodies/sfml-logo-small.png)  
This is a project template for creating SFML application for Windows, macOS, and Linux without using CMake or other build programs. This makes it very easy to edit your code on someone's computer as the code in the project is handle by a Python script. Python is including on almost all Unix-based operating systems and doesn't require admin permissions to install on Windows and its very easy to edit to your liking.

## Questions and Answers
Any pre-added questions are answered here. Almost like advertisment.  

### Who is this for?
This project template is for C++ developers, specifically game developers that want to create a SFML application quickly and cleanly on multiple platforms without wasting time making platform specific scripts to compile code. While Make could be a canidate for this, it is missing alot of commands that would make the process of deleting directories or copying multiple files pretty hard.  

### Is this safe?
Yes! Indeed all this code is completely safe unless its a fork, in which that case you should check the source code to ensure everything is safe code and doesn't destroy your computer in the process.

### What are the supported programming languages?

For the most part only C++ is support as that is the language SFML was wrote for, but with bindings like CSFML you should be able to write pure C code for your SFML application.

### How do I get started?
